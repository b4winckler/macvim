Test for Visual mode and operators

Tests for the two kinds of operations: Those executed with Visual mode
followed by an operator and those executed via Operator-pending mode. Also
part of the test are mappings, counts, and repetition with the . command.

Test cases:
- Visual modes (v V CTRL-V) followed by an operator; count; repeating
- Visual mode maps; count; repeating
  - Simple
  - With an Ex command (custom text object)
- Operator-pending mode maps
  - Simple
  - With Ex command moving the cursor
  - With Ex command and Visual selection (custom text object)
- Patch 7.3.879: Properly abort Ex command in Operator-pending mode
